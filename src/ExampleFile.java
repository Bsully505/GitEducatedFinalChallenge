sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
        Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
        and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
        was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
        neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The

        chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
        and backed out of number four’s drive.
        It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst
